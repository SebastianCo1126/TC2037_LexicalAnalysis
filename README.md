# TC2037_LexicalAnalysis

## Description
This repository makes a lexical analysis on a langauge composed of five elvish words from the fantasy series 'The Lord of the Rings'. The language is composed of the following five words Σ = {ëar, echor echuir, edain, edhel}. 

I built a Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) to implement my lexical analysis. My solution was modeled with 12 states represented by the letter q.
- q0, q1, q2... q11

## Model of the solution
Now I present the DFA I created.
